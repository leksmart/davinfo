Developing an understanding of which epigenetic variations are important in developing and progressing disease will enhance our knowledge of disease mechanisms and improve our ability to predict disease and target interventions to high-risk sub-populations. Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has an extremely high mortality/incidence ratio and poor 5-year survival rates about 7%, especially among non-resectable disease where mean survival is 3-6 months.\r\nFor patients with early stage and resectable disease the mean survival is much better at 32 months. Unfortunately, limited progress has been made identifying and validated such epigenetic marker panels for PDAC in the epidemiological setting. Most epigenome-wide studies (EWAS) rely on statistical evidence of effect alone and are often likely to be underpowered to detect modest differences. In this proposed work, we will develop a two-stage multi-omics approach that addresses the limitations of standard EWAS approaches and provides validation of identified key networks. We will apply our approach using tumor samples collected in a clinical setting….\r\n\r\n \r\nProject Lead: Dr. Rick Jansen | Department of Public Health, North Dakota State University.*\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
